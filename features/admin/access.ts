 * session `cookieCache` — the cached cookie keeps serving the pre-promotion
 * role until `updateAge` elapses, so without this a freshly promoted admin
 * is bounced until they sign in again. Banned users are always refused,
 * even when allowlisted.
 *
 * Two properties to keep in mind before describing this as authoritative:
 *
 * - The `role === "admin"` fast path returns **without reading the database**,
 *   and the session it reads comes from the cookie cache while that cache is
 *   warm. A demotion or ban is therefore not observed until the cache lapses
 *   (bounded by `session.cookieCache.maxAge`, 300s in this app). That is a
 *   deliberate trade for the common case, not an oversight — but it means this
 *   gate is DB-checked, not DB-authoritative.
 * - The database read only happens on the non-`admin` branch.
 *
 * Memoized per request: the console shell streams the gate from several
 * independent Suspense slots (sidebar menu, mobile menu, theme sync) while
 * page regions and queries re-check it, so without this the DB fallback
 * would run once per slot.
