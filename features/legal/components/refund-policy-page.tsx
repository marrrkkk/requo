          You can cancel your subscription at any time through the{" "}
          {legalConfig.paymentProvider} customer portal linked from your
          billing settings. Cancellation is separate from a refund and does
          not, by itself, issue money back.

        <LegalSubheading>Access After Cancellation</LegalSubheading>
        <LegalParagraph>
          When you cancel a subscription, you keep paid features until the end
          of the current billing period. At the end of that period your
          business reverts to the free plan. If you also want the payment
          refunded, request it through the portal using the steps above.

          Cancelling a subscription stops future charges but does not, by

          chargeback with your provider or card issuer, please contact us so
