/**
 * Prompt template for the quote_draft task — grounded pipeline.
 *
 * Complex task — structured output, system prompt ≤1600 tokens.
 * Context is a pre-assembled text block containing:
 * - inquiry context
 * - retrieved knowledge evidence (scope-only; NEVER monetary authority)
 * - pricing candidates (with IDs; prices visible for reference, never trusted)
 * - revision request / current items
 *
 * The model NEVER authors prices. It returns candidate IDs and match types;
 * the server hydrates actual prices from the pricing library deterministically.
