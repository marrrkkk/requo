/**
 * scripts/backfill-pack-assignments.ts
 *
 * Verticalization migration strategy (step 4): seed behavior-pack
 * assignments for businesses created before F-01, deriving each pack from
 * the stored business type via the single resolver choke point.
 *
 * Additive and idempotent: only businesses WITHOUT an assignment row are
 * touched, and only new assignment + history rows are inserted. Stored
 * types, forms, quotes, invoices, and snapshots are never modified.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/backfill-pack-assignments.ts
 * Requires: DATABASE_URL (or the standard app env).
