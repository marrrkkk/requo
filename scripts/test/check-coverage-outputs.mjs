// Verifies that `npm run test:coverage` produced the expected v8 coverage
// artifacts on disk: the HTML report (`coverage/index.html`) and the
// machine-readable companion of the stdout text summary
// (`coverage/coverage-final.json`, emitted by Vitest's `json` reporter
// whenever the v8 provider collected data).
//
// Exits non-zero with a stderr message naming the missing format when either
// report is absent. Exits 0 otherwise.
//
// Coverage itself stays report-only during rollout (no thresholds), so this
// check is structural: it guarantees the verify job has artifacts to upload
// and surfaces misconfigurations that silently drop a reporter.
//
// Satisfies Requirements 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6 of the
// test-infrastructure-cicd spec.

 * Reports required to be present after `npm run test:coverage`.
 *
 * - `html`: Vitest's v8 `html` reporter writes `coverage/index.html` plus a
 *   per-file HTML tree. The root `index.html` is the stable entry point.
 * - `text`: Vitest's v8 `text` reporter writes a summary table to stdout and
 *   does not create a file of its own. `coverage/coverage-final.json` is the
 *   on-disk artifact produced alongside the text summary whenever the v8
 *   provider actually collected data, so its presence is the reliable signal
 *   that the text report materialized.
