    answer:
      "If quotes live in one spreadsheet and follow-ups live in your head, yes: Requo keeps the inquiry, versions, view status, follow-ups, and invoice on one record. If your sheet encodes unusual pricing logic nothing else supports, keep it alongside Requo until the library covers it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import my spreadsheet data?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Requo includes CSV exports for inquiries and quotes, and you can rebuild your price list as products and pricing entries so future quotes start from the library instead of a tab.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do spreadsheets still do better?",
    answer:
      "Ad-hoc math and one-off analyses. Requo is opinionated about the inquiry-to-paid loop; a spreadsheet stays useful for custom calculations no quote tool would build in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Requo do everything a spreadsheet does?",
    answer:
      "No — deliberately not. Requo tracks the commercial loop and records manual payments, but it has no job scheduling or dispatch and processes no online payments.",
