    question: "Is Requo a Jobber or Housecall Pro alternative?",
    answer:
      "Only partly. If you need scheduling, dispatch, and route management, those suites are the right call — Requo has none of that. If your bottleneck is quoting custom work and following up, Requo covers that loop without the suite you would not use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Requo alongside job-management software?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many owners quote in one place and schedule in another. Requo keeps the commercial trail — inquiry, quote versions, views, follow-ups, invoice, payments — and your suite keeps the calendar.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Requo process payments like those suites?",
    answer:
      "No. Job suites typically process cards; Requo records manual payments — cash, bank transfer, GCash, Maya, check — and tracks the invoice from unpaid to paid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who should pick Requo instead?",
    answer:
      "Solo owners and small teams whose jobs start with a custom inquiry and a custom quote, and who lose work to slow responses and missed follow-ups rather than to scheduling chaos.",
