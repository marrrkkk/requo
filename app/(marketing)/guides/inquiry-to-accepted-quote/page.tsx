  {
    name: "Qualify and draft the quote",
    text: "Review the inquiry, then draft from your pricing library, templates, and past quotes — AI assembles a starting point with confidence labels, and you set every price before anything is sent.",
  },
  {
    name: "Send a secure link",
    text: "Share the quote by Requo email or paste the public link into WhatsApp, SMS, or Messenger. The customer opens it on any device with no account needed and can accept, decline, or request per-item changes.",
  },
  {
    name: "Track the view and follow up",
    text: "The first view is stamped and notifies you. Nudge open quotes with follow-up tasks and reminders — Pro and Business plans can also send automatic follow-up emails while you wait.",

    name: "Win it and invoice to paid",

  {
    question: "How long should each step take?",

      "Capture is instant with a good form, drafting takes minutes from the pricing library, and the view usually lands within a day. Follow-up timing matters most: nudge within a few days of the first view, not weeks later.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the customer requests changes?",
    answer:
      "Change requests arrive with comments on individual line items. Adjust the lines and resend as a new version — every version stays snapshotted, so the approved scope is never ambiguous.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the quote expires?",
    answer:
      "Set a validity date when you send. Expired quotes are marked automatically, and you can revise and resend rather than honoring a stale price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need the paid plans for this workflow?",
