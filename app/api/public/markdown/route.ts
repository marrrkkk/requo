Requo is quote and inquiry management software for service businesses. It connects the workflow from inquiry to quote, quote response, and follow-up.

## Capabilities

- **Inquiries**: Capture requests through public forms, a customer-facing Agent, or manual entry; search, filter, qualify, and detect potential duplicates.
- **Quotes**: Create professional quotes from inquiries, use products and quote templates, share by public link or Requo email, and track draft, sent, viewed, accepted, rejected, expired, and voided states.
- **Follow-ups**: Create reminders for inquiries and quotes, or automatically send follow-up emails on Pro and Business plans.
- **AI drafting**: Generate reviewable quote drafts grounded in your pricing library, past quotes, templates, and business knowledge.
- **Analytics and exports**: Review conversion and workflow performance, schedule reports on paid plans, and export inquiries and quotes as CSV.
- **Assistant and Agent**: The owner Assistant operates on business data inside the dashboard; the public Agent answers questions and collects qualified inquiries on Pro and Business plans.
