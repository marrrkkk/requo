    question: "What exactly does Requo do?",
    answer:
      "Requo is quote and inquiry management software for service businesses. Capture requests, draft professional quotes, send them by email or public link, track viewed and accepted status, and follow up before opportunities go cold.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my customers need to sign up to open a quote?",
    answer:
      "No. Every quote gets a public link. Your customers open it on their phone or computer, review the details, and accept or reject with one tap. No account needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add inquiries that came from calls, DMs, or referrals?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Share your public form for inbound requests, or manually add inquiries in seconds. Include the customer name, request details, and any files. AI automatically flags potential duplicates.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI quote generation work?",
    answer:
      "When you create a quote, AI pulls line items from your pricing library, past quotes, and business knowledge. You review the draft, adjust pricing or scope, and send. Confidence labels show which items were matched versus estimated.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know when a quote is viewed or needs a follow-up?",
    answer:
      "Every quote tracks its status: draft, sent, viewed, accepted, rejected, expired, or voided. You can create follow-up reminders for inquiries and quotes, and Pro and Business plans can automatically send follow-up emails when customers have not responded.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Requo send emails or do I share the link myself?",
    answer:
      "Both work. Send quotes through Requo's email system, or copy the link and share via WhatsApp, text message, Messenger, or whatever channel you already use with customers.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after a customer accepts?",
    answer:
      "The quote is marked accepted and stays connected to the inquiry and customer details. From there you can convert it into an invoice, send it by email, and track manual payments to paid. Requo does not include job scheduling or dispatch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can my team work inside the same business?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The Business plan supports up to five members with roles and shared access to the business workspace, including inquiries, quotes, forms, follow-ups, and analytics. Free and Pro are designed for solo owners.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run more than one business from one account?",
    answer:
      "Yes. One login can manage multiple businesses, with separate inquiries, quotes, forms, pricing libraries, knowledge, and branding for each. The Free plan includes one free business; additional businesses require their own paid subscription.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Requo for?",
    answer:
      "Requo is built for service businesses that receive custom inquiries and prepare custom-scope quotes. If customers reach out to ask for pricing before committing, and you write up a quote specific to their request, Requo helps you respond faster and follow up before they choose someone else. Appointment-first businesses with fixed services aren't the primary fit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free plan?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Free includes the core inquiry-to-quote workflow, unlimited inquiries and quotes, manual follow-up reminders, CSV exports, one live inquiry form, and about 10 AI quote drafts per month. Upgrade when you need automatic follow-ups, more forms, advanced analytics, or team access.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a Requo subscription cost?",
    answer:
      "Requo has three business plans. Free is $0. Pro is $9 per month or $90 per year. Business is $24 per month or $240 per year. Annual billing includes two months free. Paid subscriptions are billed per business, and the pricing page shows the current plan limits and included features.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Requo include an AI assistant or customer chat?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The owner Assistant helps members search business data, create inquiries and quotes, and review metrics inside the dashboard. Pro and Business plans also include a public customer-facing Agent that can answer questions and collect qualified inquiries from your website. AI usage is subject to plan limits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own pricing and business knowledge?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Add reusable products, pricing entries, quote templates, and business knowledge. AI quote drafts use that context to suggest relevant line items and wording, while you review and approve every draft before sending.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my inquiries and quotes?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Requo includes CSV exports for inquiries and quotes, so you can keep a copy of your operational data or analyze it elsewhere.",
  },
