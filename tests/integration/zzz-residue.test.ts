/**
 * Integration residue check (Task 4.7, Requirements 5.13, 10.4, 10.9).
 *
 * This file must execute after all other integration tests. Filename chosen
 * so Vitest's default alphabetical file ordering places it last.
 *
 * Why `zzz-` and not `_afterAll/` as the task header suggests: Vitest sorts
 * file paths with a plain string compare, and `_` (ASCII 95) sorts BEFORE
 * lowercase letters (ASCII 97+). A `_afterAll/residue.test.ts` path would
 * therefore run FIRST in the integration suite, which is the opposite of
 * what Requirement 5.13 asks for. `zzz-` guarantees last-alphabetical
 * position across both POSIX and Windows filename comparers.
 *
 * Scope and limitations:
 * - The scan covers the twelve tables listed in Requirement 10.4's cleanup
 *   set. All of them expose a `text("id")` primary key, so a `LIKE` scan on
 *   `id` is well-defined.
 * - Per-file attribution only catches rows whose `id` starts with a known
 *   `Per_File_Prefix`. Fixture-created rows follow this convention; product
 *   code that generates ids through `nanoid()`-style helpers does not, but
 *   those rows are typically cascade-deleted when their owning business or
 *   user is removed by the fixture teardown.
 * - `LIKE '<prefix>%'` is used as a cheap index-friendly pre-filter. The
 *   final decision uses JavaScript `startsWith(prefix + "_")` so that SQL
 *   `LIKE`'s `_` single-character wildcard semantics cannot widen the match.
 *
 * Known prefixes are derived by listing sibling `*.test.ts` files in
 * `tests/integration/` (non-recursive, self excluded) and piping each
 * basename through `derivePerFilePrefix`. That matches the convention used
 * by every integration test in this directory.
